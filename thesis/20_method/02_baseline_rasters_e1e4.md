## Baseline Raster Encodings (E1–E4)

In order to establish a consistent comparison framework, four baseline LiDAR raster encodings were evaluated as the fourth input channel in DEYOLO. Each encoding transforms the raw Z-buffered depth map (projected LiDAR points aligned with the RGB camera plane) into a single-channel raster image. Z-buffering ensures that only the nearest valid LiDAR return is stored per pixel, while *masking* distinguishes between valid measurements and empty regions, and *denoising* fills or smooths sparse areas to create more coherent structures suitable for convolutional processing. All rasters were normalized to an 8-bit range and concatenated with the RGB channels, resulting in a four-channel input tensor of shape [4, H, W].

- **E1 — Inverse-depth (denoised, masked):** Encodes proximity as brightness by taking the inverse of depth values. Invalid pixels are masked, and the depth map is denoised to reduce sparsity. This emphasizes nearby obstacles and produces continuous object silhouettes that are more amenable to CNN feature extraction.
- **E2 — Log-depth (denoised, masked):** Applies a logarithmic transform to depth before normalization. This compresses far-range variation and prevents distant structures (e.g., roads or buildings) from collapsing into near-uniform intensity, thereby providing richer global context.
- **E3 — Inverse-depth variant (inv_d3):** Uses an alternative inverse scaling scheme that accentuates very close ranges more strongly than the standard inverse transform. This variant is intended to highlight near-field collision risks by assigning high contrast to nearby objects.
- **E4 — Zero-IR (RGB-only):** A control experiment in which the LiDAR channel is replaced with a constant zero image. This baseline quantifies the marginal benefit of LiDAR information by comparing against RGB-only training under otherwise identical conditions.

Together, these four configurations form the baseline rasterization set. They capture standard depth encodings used in prior RGB-D literature (inverse, log, and control) while introducing a simple variant (inv_d3) to test sensitivity to scaling. Results from E1–E4 provide the reference against which more advanced encodings—such as height-above-ground, obstacle strip, or gradient magnitude—can be compared in subsequent experiments.
